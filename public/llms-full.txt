# Elemental — Full Context for LLMs

## Identity
Elemental is the advisory practice of Vishal Kapadia, based in Zurich/Zug, Switzerland. Vishal advises institutional actors on digital asset adoption — the structural, operational, and regulatory work required to make digital asset exposure viable for regulated institutions.

## Why This Practice Exists
Digital assets are entering institutional portfolios, but the operating reality hasn't caught up. For wealth managers, family offices, and fund operators, the hard problems are custody architecture, governance structure, counterparty risk, MiCA compliance, and integration with existing investment processes. Most platforms are built for retail adoption. Institutional entry requires a different playbook — one built around what holds up under regulatory and fiduciary scrutiny. The MiCA transition window is open now. The platforms that move in the next 12 months will define the institutional digital asset landscape for the next decade.

## Approach
I help digital asset platforms get taken seriously by institutional buyers. That means building the infrastructure, the positioning, and the relationships that make a regulated institution say yes. I've done this at the intersection of on-chain infrastructure and institutional finance — where the trust bar is highest and the playbook doesn't exist yet.

### Specialisations
- Custody, fund structure, and jurisdiction decisions that don't create regulatory problems later
- GTM frameworks that work with institutional procurement, not against it
- Positioning that translates digital asset capability into language compliance teams approve
- Partner relationships built for revenue, not announcements
- MiCA compliance and FINMA regulatory posture for platforms entering Switzerland and the EU

### Working Style
I work with 3–4 organisations at a time. Engagements are scoped, senior-led, and measured by institutional outcomes — not activity or tactical output. I engage with ownership, prioritise clarity over hype, and operate within institutional norms of confidentiality and discretion.

### What This Is Not
I don't do retainers that produce slide decks. I don't advise on token launches, community growth, or retail distribution. I don't take on engagements where the ask is to make something sound institutional without doing the structural work.

## Track Record (detailed)

### Endaoment — $25M to $130M AUM
Grew Endaoment, an on-chain donor-advised fund, from $25M to $130M in assets under management by pivoting go-to-market toward HNW individuals and wealth managers. Defined the institutional positioning, partner strategy, and sales motion that unlocked the $250B donor-advised fund industry for on-chain infrastructure.

### KlimaDAO — $1B market cap at launch
Early contributor to KlimaDAO, which reached a $1B market cap at launch and brought 25 million tons of carbon on-chain. Defined partner strategy and institutional positioning during the protocol's launch phase. Coined the term 'digital carbon', now standard industry language.

### Policy and institutional adoption
Advisor to the United Nations and European Commission on digital asset policy and adoption frameworks. Contributed to the formation of on-chain carbon markets and informed how institutional buyers and funds engage with tokenised environmental assets.

## Selected Client Outcomes
- Defined the operating model for a family office's first digital asset allocation — custody selection, governance structure, and reporting integration

- Built partner evaluation and selection logic for custodians and execution venues, used to shortlist and onboard three infrastructure providers
