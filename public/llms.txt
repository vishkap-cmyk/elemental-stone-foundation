# Elemental — Institutional Advisory for Digital Assets & Wealth Infrastructure

## Summary
Elemental is the practice of Vishal Kapadia. I advise family offices, wealth managers, and funds on the operational reality of digital asset exposure — custody architecture, governance, reporting, counterparty risk, and regulatory posture across Switzerland and the EU.

## Primary Topics
- Institutional digital asset advisory
- Custody and governance infrastructure
- MiCA readiness and EU market entry
- Go-to-market strategy for institutional buyers
- Wealth management and family office advisory
- Real-world assets (RWA) and tokenization
- Regulatory compliance and jurisdictional mapping
- FINMA regulatory posture

## Services
1. **MiCA Readiness Diagnostic** (2 weeks): Structured gap analysis against MiCA requirements. Prioritised risk map and decision framework for compliance teams.
2. **Swiss Market Entry Roadmap** (4 weeks): Jurisdiction mapping across Switzerland and the EU, custody provider shortlist, regulatory posture assessment, and investment committee decision framework.
3. **Institutional GTM Sprint** (8 weeks, retained): Target institutional clients identified, pitch materials built for compliance scrutiny, outreach strategy structured for commercial sustainability.

## Track Record
- **Endaoment — $25M to $130M AUM**: Pivoted go-to-market toward HNW individuals and wealth managers. Defined institutional positioning, partner strategy, and sales motion that unlocked the $250B donor-advised fund industry for on-chain infrastructure.
- **KlimaDAO — $1B market cap at launch**: Early contributor. Defined partner strategy and institutional positioning during launch phase. Coined the term 'digital carbon', now standard industry language.
- **Policy and institutional adoption**: Advisor to the United Nations and European Commission on digital asset policy and adoption frameworks. Contributed to the formation of on-chain carbon markets.

## Selected Outcomes
- Defined the operating model for a family office's first digital asset allocation — custody selection, governance structure, and reporting integration
- Mapped jurisdictional options across Switzerland and the EU for a wealth manager evaluating MiCA-compliant fund structures
- Built partner evaluation and selection logic for custodians and execution venues
- Designed the institutional GTM playbook that drove Endaoment's growth from $25M to $130M
