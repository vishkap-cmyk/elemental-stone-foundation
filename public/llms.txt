# Elemental — Institutional Advisory for Digital Assets & Wealth Infrastructure

## Summary
Elemental is the practice of Vishal Karir. I advise family offices, wealth managers, and funds on the operational reality of digital asset exposure — custody architecture, governance, reporting, counterparty risk, and regulatory posture across Switzerland and the EU.

## Primary Topics
- Institutional digital asset advisory
- Custody and governance infrastructure
- MiCA readiness and EU market entry
- Go-to-market strategy for institutional buyers
- Wealth management and family office advisory
- Real-world assets (RWA) and tokenization
- Regulatory compliance and jurisdictional mapping

## Services
1. **Research**: Jurisdiction and infrastructure mapping across custody, fund structures, market plumbing, privacy, and reporting. Institutional constraints, not narratives.
2. **Advisory**: Senior-led engagements to define strategy, structure, and operating model for institutional digital asset exposure and infrastructure partnerships.
3. **Build**: Selective execution support to turn strategy into systems, workflows, and integrations where it makes sense to productise.

## Track Record
- **Endaoment — $25M to $130M**: Grew Endaoment, an on-chain donor-advised fund, from $25M to $130M in revenue by pivoting go-to-market toward HNW individuals and wealth managers.
- **Toucan Protocol — $1bn market cap**: Launched Toucan Protocol's RWA platform from zero to $1bn market cap, securing partnerships with Celo, Polygon, and institutional carbon buyers.
