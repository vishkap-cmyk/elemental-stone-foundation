        <h1>Elemental — Institutional Advisory for Digital Assets & Wealth Infrastructure</h1>
        <p>I'm Vishal Kapadia. I help digital asset platforms, family offices, and wealth managers navigate the operational reality of institutional adoption — custody, governance, MiCA compliance, and the relationships that make regulated institutions say yes.</p>

        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>Digital assets are entering institutional portfolios. The operating reality hasn't caught up. The MiCA transition window is open now. The platforms that move in the next 12 months will define the institutional digital asset landscape for the next decade.</p>

          <li><strong>Swiss Market Entry Roadmap (4 weeks):</strong> Jurisdiction mapping, custody provider shortlist, regulatory posture assessment, and investment committee decision framework.</li>
          <li><strong>Institutional GTM Sprint (8 weeks, retained):</strong> Target institutional clients identified, pitch materials built, outreach strategy structured for commercial sustainability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Track Record</h2>

          <li><strong>KlimaDAO — $1B market cap at launch:</strong> Defined partner strategy and institutional positioning. Coined the term 'digital carbon'.</li>
          <li><strong>Policy and institutional adoption:</strong> Advisor to the United Nations and European Commission on digital asset policy and adoption frameworks.</li>
